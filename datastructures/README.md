# Data Structures

In this repository, this just has implementations shown data structures implementations that were implemented in a data structures and algorithms class. Solely purpose to learn and understand fundamentally what data structures are, including utilizing the C++'s STL for actual usage, and prevent re-inventing the wheel as well.


## Queue and Stacks
In this repository, we implement stacks and queues. Learning about fundamentals of data structures, considered as an introductory into learning data structures. 

## Linked Lists
We implement a standard linked lists focusing on learning pointers by properly newing and deleting, proper class design, and properly implementing a linked list with considerations of rule of thumbs.

## Hash Tables
Understanding hash tables was the focus for this implementation. As well, the assignment involved getting exposed to applying shell-scripting to look at an optimization stand point, of which of the three hash table implementations are faster. As in C++, we implement Linear Probing, Chaining, and Double Hashing. As we look of these three and check their implementation. By using shell scripting in automating inputs to check based on the size of inputs how long would each implementation take depending on the size of inputs.

## Inventory
Purpose of Inventory is to learn about set theory. In this context, we learn about sets and subsets, and including understanding how std::set<T>'s work in C++, as well using the C++ STL set to really understand fundamentally what sets are.
