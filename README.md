# portfolios

-- UPDATE --
Date: January 25th, 2023
* This is an outdated portfolio repo. 
* Plan to implement more in depth projects that would be considered useful, and have their own usefulness in their respective focuses.

This Github repo contains projects I have done, academically and personally. Displaying the applications of concepts, and usage that I have learned to apply into my own projects. In which have been very useful, when developing these personal projects into fruition.

UPDATE (Jan 4th, 2023)
- These are the first portfolio projects that I posted on github, the date shown is the day that started to keep track of the portfolios that I have developed over the course of my career.

# Hand-Gesture Detection

When implementing this hand detection, the idea was using this implementation for ROS development. To do interaction with hardware, such as when we detect a users hand, the robot would be able to detect through this detection.

# Linear Algebra Framework
This image shows how many test cases if the framework passing, for deployment.
Applying end-to-end testing, for testing output of the framework, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and other basic features of matrices arithmetic.

# Data Structures Folder
Here, in this folder are just some data structures implementation both implemented during data structures, and discrete mathematics. While also utilizing templates.

Including topics that were covered in discrete mathematics, such as set theory, demorgans law, and graph theory implemented in C++.
