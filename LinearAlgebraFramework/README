Linear Algebra Library

1.) Implementing Matrix.h
    - Adding, Subtracting, and Multiplying two matrices together
    - Adding, Subtracting, and Multiplying a matrix with a scalar val
    - Squaring two matrices.
    - Displaying specific indexes in a matrix.

1.2) Updated Matrix.h to only take integers, doubles, and floats only.

2.) Implementing an inverse matrix.
    - Purpose of an inverse of a matrix.
    -> Using Gauss-Jordan elimination algorithm
    
    Ex) Considering a system of equations,
        - a11x1 + a12x2 + a13x3 = b1
        - a21x1 + a22x2 + a23x3 = b2
        - a31x1 + a32x2 + a33x3 = b3
    - To look at why we need this algorithm, as a good example
      is to solve these kinds of linear systems of equations.
    - Which this has three equations, and three unknowns,
       the unknowns being x1, x2, and x3.
    - Coefficient being the three equations represented as a11 - a33
    - Output begin b1 - b3
